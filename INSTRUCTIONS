NOTICE:
	Always compile with the built-in scons, newer versions fail to build!

--------------------------------------
To compile & install into /usr/bin
scons/scons.py install PREFIX=/usr
--------------------------------------
If you are running a Debian-Based Distro, like Ubuntu and want Museeq, use
./build-museeq-deb

On Debian-distros: export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3

If you don't wish to install into /usr right now
(maybe you're making a .deb file?), you can run:
 
./install-temp-museeq-deb ( install into ~/museek+/tmp/ )

if you don't want Museeq run:
./build-no-museeq

if your QTDIR variable is set properly just run,
./build
./install-temp  ( install into ~/museek+/tmp/ )

You can view the build scripts to see what messages they pass to scons
