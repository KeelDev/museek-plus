 * Make Muscan work properly on Sparc (Big Endian problem?)

 * Up/Down transfer rate status in status bar
 * Round robin queueing
 * "max amount of MB's per day per user/list-user" (suggested by Dalai on slsk forum Mar 27 2004, 11:30 AM) (This feature would limit certain users to a maximum total amount downloaded per day.)
 * swarmed downloads
