TODO list:

* Auto-Away in museekd (chs_kasper's idea)
* Make Muscan work properly on Sparc (Big Endian problem?)
* Make museeq convert newlines to spliting off seperate messages to facilitate pasting debug messages.
* Fix segfault that happens immediately after a "timeout connecting to host" DEBUG message.
* Find out why some SCONS versions other than v0.95 do not compile museeq .ui.h files correctly.
  and instead give errors like: "SettingsDlg::SReloadShares_clicked(): Not implemented yet"
* Find out why uploading to windows soulseek is still broken, even after peer message
  52 was sent.
* Adding logging of Chat Rooms and Private Message to museeq
* Upload limits

[mer.lin.ux's ideas]

- Improve documentation (explain how to rescan shares, including the SIGHUP 
  method of refreshing a rescan)
- have Museeq optionally remember interface password
- wishlist (with auto-download)

Unlikely to be added anytime soon:

- Up/Down transfer rate status in status bar
- Up/Down transfer limiting
- Round robin queueing
- "max amount of MB's per day per user/list-user" (suggested by Dalai on slsk forum 
  Mar 27 2004, 11:30 AM) (This feature would limit certain users to a maximum 
  total amount downloaded per day.)
- swarmed downloads
- Single user searching (would require a new interface message, but otherwise be easy)
* Trusted users -> Privileges to individual buddies (chs_kasper) 

REASON: Buddies already have optional special privileges "privilege_buddies", 
but it applies to ALL buddies if enabled. Maybe I'll implement something like 
this later, but for now it's on the back-burner.
* 

DONE:

* Added Retry-Upload popup-menu item in museeq

* use loopback device or local IP for browsing local shares, instead of external IP.
 (This allows one to browse his own shares while behind a router that is configured to filter internal
 NAT redirection.  Allowing internal NAT redirection is a security hazard because it makes it easier
 for a hacker outside your LAN to spoof IP addresses in packets sent to systems behind your
 router) ->  (this would require telling museekd its external and internal IP address in the config file)

* Added Refresh buttons to Shares and Userinfo in Museeq (mer.lin.ux's idea)
 ((  refreshable "Browse Shares" and "User Info" windows (instead of requiring the user to close the page and then reopen it) ))

* Implement the new room/user search messages 42 and 120

* Recieve Remote upoads only from Trusted Users

* Send Remote uploads to other users (Needs more work)

* Settings dialog for museeq

* Add a IFACE messages to disconnect and reconnect museekd to the server, 
  to facilitate username or server changes without having to restart museekd.

* Add a IFACE Message to reload shares (NOT rescan)

* ReArrange Okay/Cancel dialogs with okay on the Left side. (groovything's idea)

* Fix QSA scripts menu's hotkey to be some other than the letter 'S'
* Make ticker disable-able
* make buddylist comments in Museeq easier to change (dragging is unusual) -- added popup-menu item

* Special Shares list that only Buddies can download from (lots of people wanted this)

* museekd should send a 'no files shared' to non-buddies when 'shared to buddies only' (chs_kasper's idea)

* Choose font (and size) for Museeq (mer.lin.ux & others)

* Put tickers in the config, and set them automatically when joining rooms.

* Make icon themes chooseable in museeq

* Added text label in museeq's shares, for whether they're recieved yet, empty 
  or if not, and how may directories are in them.

"i had a wish... or a suggestion for museek-todo: winslsk shows messages like 'no files shared' or 'error getting filelist' when browsing users. it would be nice if museeq shows that too."  (chs_kasper's idea)

Can't do this part, though: "also nice is a progress-bar for browsing users like nicotine has." (chs_kasper's idea)
