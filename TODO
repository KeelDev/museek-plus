General To Dos
 * Right-click in upload-queue gives a option 'message all downloading users' (chs_kasper)
 * Auto-Away in museekd (chs_kasper's idea)
 * Make Muscan work properly on Sparc (Big Endian problem?)
 * Make museeq convert newlines to spliting off seperate messages to facilitate pasting debug messages.
 * Find out why uploading to windows soulseek is still sometimes broken, even after peer message 52 was sent.
 * Adding logging of Chat Rooms and Private Message to museeq
 * Upload limits
 * Wishlist - with auto-download. (mer.lin.ux) Status: Partially complete (untimed searches only)

Bugs
 * None discovered, yet
 
Unlikely to be added anytime soon

 * Up/Down transfer rate status in status bar
 * Up/Down transfer limiting
 * Round robin queueing
 * "max amount of MB's per day per user/list-user" (suggested by Dalai on slsk forum Mar 27 2004, 11:30 AM) (This feature would limit certain users to a maximum total amount downloaded per day.)
 * swarmed downloads
 * Trusted users -> Privileges to individual buddies (chs_kasper) REASON: Buddies already have optional special privileges "privilege_buddies", but it applies to ALL buddies if enabled.
 
==============================================================================

DONE:
 * Drop-Down list in museeq for user-initiated-uploads (When browsing your own shares, add a buddylist dropdown menu from the 'Upload files' option to simplify uploading files to your buddies.) (daelstorm)
 * Find out why some SCONS versions other than v0.95 do not compile museeq .ui.h files correctly. and instead give errors like: " SettingsDlg::SReloadShares_clicked(): Not implemented yet" (doesn't matter anymore, issue went away when .ui files were ported to pure c++)
 * Show things like 'send search results 123 to user xyz' in the new museeq log-window (chs_kasper's request) (daelstorm) 
 
FIXED BUGS:
 * Museeq crashes 2-3 seconds after you disconnect while connecting. the bug is in museekdriver.cpp I added a check for mSocket in dataReady(), but it didn't help. I also tried flush(), close(), and clearPendingData() on the socket, but nothing helped. (hyriand)
 * museekd crashes a little while after a initializing transfer is cleared or aborted. the bug is somewhere is the TransferManager? and goes thru TransferManager::cannot_connect (hyriand)
 * Fix segfault that happens immediately after a "timeout connecting to host" DEBUG message. (hyriand)
