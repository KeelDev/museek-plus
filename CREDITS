Credits go to (in no particular order):

anadyr, daelstorm, SmackleFunky, (va)*10^3 and Wretched
  for supplying me with feedback, risking their boxes and
  quite possibly their lives and sanity while testing my
  not always bug-free code


alexbk
  for reverse-engineering most of the SoulSeek protocol and
  creating his PySoulSeek client


Nir
  for creating and maintaining the SoulSeek network



The people that wrote:


The AES cipher module used in the Linux kernel

The SHA256 hash module used in the Linux kernel

Solar Designer
  for creating the public domain md5 hash routines

Paul Kocher
  for his SHA-1 hash routines

And last, but certainly not least, all the users of both Nicotine and
Museek.

-----------------------------------
Below is for Museek-plus (post-svn) 
-----------------------------------

SeeSchloss
   For the room searching function (now-defunct) in museekd and museeq
   and for writing the OpenSource Soulfind Soulseek-Server, which, among other
   things, allows much greater flexibility in client programming and testing, 
   without the fears of damaging Soulseek, itself or getting banned.
Daelstorm
   For coding new features into museekd and museeq.
sierracat
   For explaining some of the Soulseek server and peer messages to daelstorm.
Belegdol
   For providing the GCC 4.1 compile fix to museeq and for his Fedora Core RPMs.
stericho
   For the Gentoo ebuilds

Ideas for features from: mer.lin.ux, chs_kasper, Requiem1348, groovything, Belegdol, cravings
and several other that I have forgotten, thanks to you, too.

For everyone who've reported bugs, thanks to you, as well.

(specific ideas mentioned in CHANGELOG and TODO)
